# Review of Web Development

Being Successful
-------------------
To be successful in this web development, there are a number of technologies that you need to know how to use:

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

1. Mention some examples of html elements?
2. Give some examples of html attributes?

2. Identify css id, class?

3. How to use bootstrap in html?

4. What's the uses of bootstrap and css?
5. How to use dev tools in web browser?

7. What is the uses of Javascript?

8. Java Script Real Life Objects, Properties, and Methods
       In real life, a car is an object.

       A car has properties like weight and color, and methods like start and stop:
       Object: car  Properties	Methods
	
              car.name = Fiat             car.start()

              car.model = 500             car.drive()

              car.weight = 850kg          car.brake()

              car.color = white	       car.stop()
              

   All cars have the same properties, but the property values differ from car to car.

       All cars have the same methods, but the methods are performed at different times.\


6. Which of the following is the correct way to declare a variable in JavaScript? (assume each line is run in isolation)

       var name = 'Asibeh'
        const name = 'Asibeh'
        name: 'Asibeh'
        set(name:'Asibeh')
7. Let's assume list of locations:

        const locations = ['Bole', 'Piasa', 'Paster', '4 Kilo', '5 Kilo', '6 Kilo'];
  
  how to correctly access the string 'Paster'?
  
      locations[2];
      
9. What is DOM?
      Remember that a JavaScript object is a tree-like structure that has properties and values. 
      
      The DOM stands for "Document Object Model" and is a tree-like structure that is a representation of the HTML document, the relationship between elements, and contains the content and properties of the elements.

  The DOM is not:

  - part of the JavaScript language
  The DOM is:

  - constructed from the browser is globally accessible by JavaScript code using the document object
  
  - The DOM is used all of the time and is what we'll be using throughout this course!
